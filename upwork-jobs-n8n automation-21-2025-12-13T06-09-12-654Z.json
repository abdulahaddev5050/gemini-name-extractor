      "Hello, I am formally disputing this refund request. I worked on this project for an entire week and completed all the work as agreed — delivering 2,000 items with full dedication and attention to detail. After I submitted the final delivery, the client removed my access to the shared Google Drive and then requested a refund. This shows clear bad faith and dishonest behavior. I have screenshots to prove that I delivered the work, sent multiple unanswered messages, and that my access was removed right after the delivery. I kindly ask that the $15.00 be released to me as fair payment for the work I honestly completed. I committed my time and energy to this project in good faith. Thank you for reviewing my case and supporting fair treatment for freelancers.",

    "title": "Single Page Marketing Site Design",
    "summary": "Overview: We are looking for a talented Web Designer and Copywriter to design and create the marketing website for our innovative prototype creation platform. Our product helps startup founders go from concept to investor-ready prototype with a range of flexible, tiered offerings—from static Figma designs to fully custom app prototypes. We need someone who can deliver both visually stunning designs and persuasive, clear copy to engage our target audience of non-technical founders.\n\nResponsibilities:\n\nWeb Design:\n\nCreate a modern, professional, and user-friendly one-page marketing website in Figma (or equivalent design tool).\n\nDesign engaging visuals, icons, and mockups that communicate the value of each service tier.\n\nHelp define the visual style for the site.\n\nProvide high-quality, responsive web designs optimized for both desktop and mobile.\n\nCopywriting:\n\nWrite compelling, clear, and concise copy that communicates our value propositions, including the 4 service tiers.\n\n1. Headline and Subheadline\nGuidance:\n\nThe headline should grab attention and immediately communicate the primary benefit of your service in a succinct, powerful way.\n\nThe subheadline should expand on the headline, giving a brief but compelling explanation of the value you provide.\n\nExample Headline:\n\"From Idea to Investor-Ready Prototype in Days.\"\n\nExample Subheadline:\n\"Launch a polished, functional app or clickable prototype quickly—without the need for a dev team. Tailored solutions for startup founders, designed to impress investors and users alike.\"\n\n2. Who This Is For (Target Audience)\nGuidance:\n\nBe specific about who your services are for: focus on founders, entrepreneurs, and startup teams who need fast, efficient solutions to bring their ideas to life.\n\nUse language that resonates with them, speaking to their pain points (time, cost, skill gap) and their ambitions (getting funding, launching their app, creating a prototype to test ideas).\n\nExample Copy:\n\"Our services are tailored for startup founders, indie hackers, and early-stage entrepreneurs. Whether you need a simple design, an interactive prototype to present to investors, or a fully functional MVP, we’re here to help. No technical team? No problem—our solutions are designed to help you validate your idea, gain investor interest, and test your app quickly.\"\n\n3. Service Descriptions (Clearly Outlining the Four Prototype Tiers)\nGuidance:\n\nClearly explain each tier's offerings and how they fit into the overall process of creating an app prototype.\n\nUse simple language and focus on the benefit of each tier—what problems does it solve and who is it ideal for?\n\nInclude an easy-to-understand visual layout (e.g., grid or step layout) to show the progression from design-only to fully custom prototypes.\n\nExample Copy for Tier 1 - Static Figma Mockup:\n\"Get a clear visual representation of your idea with a static Figma design. This tier includes one fully-designed page layout, optimized for both desktop and mobile. Perfect for founders looking to showcase their app concept or use it as a foundation for further development.\"\n\nExample Copy for Tier 2 - Clickable Prototype:\n\"Move from static design to an interactive prototype with clickable user flows. This tier allows potential users and investors to experience your app's UX firsthand. Ideal for validating your app's usability and demonstrating functionality.\"\n\nExample Copy for Tier 3 - No-Code App Prototype:\n\"Turn your design into a functional app prototype using pre-built components. This semi-functional MVP allows you to test and demo your app's core features without writing code, making it perfect for testing ideas and getting early feedback from users.\"\n\nExample Copy for Tier 4 - Fully Custom Prototype:\n\"Get a fully interactive, custom-built app prototype with complex logic, integrations, and animations. Perfect for startups ready to validate a sophisticated MVP or present to investors with a polished, functional app demo.\"\n\n4. Testimonials or Use Cases (Either Provided or Created)\nGuidance:\n\nIf you have any existing testimonials, showcase them prominently. If not, create hypothetical use cases to demonstrate how your services have impacted clients in real-world situations.\n\nThe key is to show how your service solves a problem and creates tangible results for the user. Make it relatable and specific.\n\nExample Testimonial:\n\"'I launched my MVP in just two weeks using the No-Code App Prototype. We were able to test our idea with real users and secure our first round of funding—couldn't have done it without the team!' — John D., Founder of FitStart\"\n\nExample Use Case:\n\"A founder needed an investor-ready prototype but didn’t have the technical expertise. After choosing Tier 3, they received a fully functional MVP that helped secure a $500K seed investment in just three weeks.\"\n\n5. Calls to Action (Encouraging Potential Customers to Book Discovery Calls or Get Started)\nGuidance:\n\nCalls to Action (CTAs) should be compelling and clear, offering the user a straightforward next step.\n\nUse strong action verbs and create a sense of urgency (but not pressure).\n\nEach section should have a CTA, and the main CTA at the end should encourage them to book a discovery call or get started.\n\nExample CTAs:\n\n\"Get Started Now\"\n\n\"Book Your Free Prototype Discovery Call\"\n\n\"Start with a Static Design Today\"\n\n\"Need a Custom Prototype? Let's Talk!\"\n\nPlacement Tips:\n\nPlace CTAs after each section where the user may feel ready to take action (e.g., after explaining each tier or after testimonials).\n\nUse buttons that stand out visually but don't overwhelm the page. Keep them concise and action-oriented.\n\nEnsure the copy is persuasive, highlights the benefits, and drives conversions.\n\nThese are the tiers of offerings the company offers:\n\nTier 1 - Static Figma Mockup\nDescription:\nThis is the simplest and most affordable option, ideal for visualizing your app idea with a static design. The mockup is created in Figma (or a similar design tool), allowing you to see your idea come to life in a visual form. It's not interactive—more of a \"first draft\" in terms of layout and user experience.\n\nTarget Audience:\n\nEntrepreneurs who are at the very beginning of their product journey.\n\nThose who need a visual representation to share with potential co-founders or investors.\n\nIdeal for a pitch presentation where you only need to showcase the overall concept.\n\nFeatures:\n\nOne static page design (desktop and mobile).\n\nFocus on layout, branding, and the core visual aspects of your app.\n\nA high-quality screenshot or export to use in pitch decks or marketing materials.\n\nWhat You Get:\n\nA visual mockup to showcase your idea.\n\nPerfect for visualizing your app without the need for complex functionality.\n\nA great first step before deciding on more advanced prototypes.\n\nTier 2 - Clickable Prototype\nDescription:\nThis tier takes the visual mockup from Tier 1 and makes it interactive. The clickable prototype simulates the flow of the app, allowing users to click through screens, but it won’t have functional features. It’s ideal for showing how the app will work from a user experience (UX) perspective.\n\nTarget Audience:\n\nFounders looking to test app usability before full development.\n\nEntrepreneurs who want to gather feedback from potential users or investors.\n\nIdeal for presenting to stakeholders or running user tests.\n\nFeatures:\n\nInteractive flow with clickable buttons and navigation between screens.\n\nBasic transitions to simulate app flow.\n\nGreat for demonstrating how the app works (without coding).\n\nWhat You Get:\n\nAn interactive prototype that simulates the app’s user experience.\n\nPerfect for showcasing your app’s functionality to investors, users, and teams.\n\nAllows for feedback on usability before building a full product.\n\nTier 3 - No-Code App Prototype\nDescription:\nA step up from the clickable prototype, this tier gives you a functional MVP (minimum viable product) using no-code tools. The app has real, functioning features that can be interacted with, tested, and demonstrated as a near-real app, though without custom development.\n\nTarget Audience:\n\nStartups with limited budgets but a need for a working prototype.\n\nEntrepreneurs who want to test their idea in the market and gather data on user interactions.\n\nIdeal for a test launch or a soft opening.\n\nFeatures:\n\nFully interactive, functional prototype using no-code tools.\n\nReal interactions like sign-up forms, data inputs, and basic logic (e.g., navigation, simple user flows).\n\nGreat for testing core features and gathering early feedback.\n\nWhat You Get:\n\nA working prototype that closely mimics a fully functional app.\n\nPerfect for demonstrating how your product works to potential customers and investors.\n\nA practical tool for gathering real-world feedback.\n\nTier 4 - Fully Custom Prototype\nDescription:\nThis is the most advanced tier, where your app prototype is custom-built with code. It’s fully interactive and includes more complex features, animations, and integrations. This prototype simulates the final product as closely as possible, making it ideal for a final-stage MVP before full-scale development.\n\nTarget Audience:\n\nFounders who need a high-fidelity prototype for investor presentations or user testing.\n\nThose who want to closely simulate the final product’s functionality, including complex features and integrations.\n\nIdeal for companies who are close to launching or need to validate specific features.\n\nFeatures:\n\nCustom-built prototype with animations, integrations, and complex features (e.g., user authentication, API calls).\n\nHigh-fidelity design with polished UI/UX.\n\nSimulates the final app experience closely, including working logic and features.\n\nWhat You Get:\n\nA high-fidelity, fully interactive app prototype.\n\nClosely mimics the final product, allowing for in-depth user testing.\n\nIdeal for attracting investors or building excitement for your product.\n\nSummary of Tiers:\n\nTier Core Features Ideal For\nTier 1: Static Figma Mockup Visual design (no interactivity) Early-stage founders, pitch presentations\nTier 2: Clickable Prototype Interactive flow, clickable screens Testing usability, gathering early feedback\nTier 3: No-Code App Prototype Real, interactive features with no-code tools User testing, MVP launches, market testing\nTier 4: Fully Custom Prototype Custom code, complex features, high-fidelity Investor demos, final-stage product testing\n\nCollaboration:\n\nWork closely with the development team to ensure the website is designed for smooth user experience and easy implementation.\n\nPresent and revise design and copy drafts based on feedback from stakeholders.\n\nRequirements:\n\nProven experience designing marketing websites with a focus on conversion.\n\nStrong portfolio showcasing web design skills, particularly in creating user-friendly and visually appealing websites.\n\nProven experience in writing persuasive copy for web marketing, with a focus on conversion optimization.\n\nAbility to create designs in Figma.\n\nExperience working with startup companies or understanding the startup ecosystem is a plus.\n\nDeliverables:\n\nFinal Figma design files with complete layouts for desktop and mobile versions.\n\nFull copy for each section of the website.\n\nPreferred Skills:\n\nFamiliarity with UX/UI best practices.\n\nAbility to work independently and meet deadlines.\n\nTimeline:\n\nWe are on a very tight timeline and need someone who can put this together within 3 days.  It is a challenge, but the right candidate can do it!",

You’ll see two buttons:\n\nRegenerate – generates a new sentence idea\n\nAccept – confirms that the current sentence pair is natural, accurate, and aligned with the vocabulary word\n\nThere’s also an Edit option in case the sentence is mostly good but needs minor tweaks, and an Undo button if you want to revisit a previous item.\n\nThe project will be divided into three milestones:\n\nCurating the word list (spreadsheet) – Review and finalize the list of words before sentence generation begins\n\nFirst half of sentence approvals (using the app) – Work through the first 1,000 words\n\nSecond half of sentence approvals (using the app) – Complete the remaining 1,000 words\n\nI’ve included a screenshot of the app below so you can get a sense of the interface.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions or need additional context.
